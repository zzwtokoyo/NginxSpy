Write-Host "=== Fix Description ===" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "Problem cause:"
Write-Host "- AsyncRelayCommand has its own _isExecuting state management"
Write-Host "- ProcessManagementViewModel IsLoading state conflicts with AsyncRelayCommand"
Write-Host "- Synchronous RefreshDataAsync call blocks UI thread"
Write-Host "- State update delay causes users to need to click twice"

Write-Host "Fix solution:"
Write-Host "- Remove IsLoading state management in ViewModel"
Write-Host "- Rely on AsyncRelayCommand _isExecuting state"
Write-Host "- Immediately update instance state for instant feedback"
Write-Host "- Asynchronously refresh data to avoid blocking UI"

Write-Host "Testing suggestions:"
Write-Host "1. Start NginxSpy application"
Write-Host "2. Add or discover an nginx instance"
Write-Host "3. Start the instance"
Write-Host "4. Click stop button once"
Write-Host "5. Verify instance status immediately changes to 'Stopped'"
Write-Host "6. Verify button state updates correctly"
